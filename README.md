# recommender_systems

Recommend to a user the exact item they would prefer is a win. However, user situations and tastes change frequently with flooding offers from everywhere.


Session-based sequential recommendation systems help to capture short-term, contextual user preferences at a given point in time and predict more precisely the next iterations.


NVIDIA-Merlin introduced #Transformers4Rec library to tackle session-based recommendation tasks by leveraging SOTA NLP Hugging Face #transformers architecture.


Simply use a short sequence of past user interactions within a session to recommend dynamically the next item they most likely would be interested in at the exact moment!

PyTorch and Tensorflow implementations are kindly available :)
